# About

Hi! I'm Sanjana.

I like working with people to build cool things.

I found my niche (or my niche found me?) in startups and product management. I love research and exploring new ideas, and taking those ideas from 0-1.

My Linguistics background lets me look at problems from crazy angles and approach ideas with intense curiousity. My CS background grounds me in logic and execution. 

I've worked in AI/ML, fintech, and networking. I have an affinity for quickly learning new concepts and delivering suggestions on how to solve a problem. 

I really enjoy diving into new problems, talking to users, and seeing what I can do to help.
