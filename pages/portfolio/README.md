## Writing Portfolio
I've written quite a bit. I've written several technical blog posts on AI, documents documenting(?) business planning + strategy, and training manuals detailing role responsibilities and lessons I've learned. Read some of my work on explainable machine learning, creating a business plan for a convenience store, and a guide on how to craft a good hackathon experience --> [Writing Portfolio](https://sanjananana.github.io/files/pdfs/Writing_Portfolio_SChowdhury.pdf).
