***

Product manager with experience in startups, mainly focusing on AI/ML (I worked with machine learning for the Mars Rover once, and I've had perpetual anxiety about bad data ever since)

I currently work with 2 startups on product marketing, UX, and branding.

Experience working in FinTech and payments, and always wondering how our existing financial systems haven't collapsed yet.

Experience leading R&D for SaaS and API products. Crazy how much you can charge for an API call.
