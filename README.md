## Hi! I'm Sanjana

I'm a proud graduate from the University of Maryland with a BS in Computer Science and BA in Linguistics. I've done some pretty cool stuff in my time. I have:
1. Organized some of the nation's largest collegiate hackathons, [Technica](https://gotechnica.org/) and [Bitcamp](https://bit.camp/) for over 4 years
2. Worked at NASA on the [ExoMars mission](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/moma) to see how machine learning can be introduced in exploring data from Mars 
3. Ran a [technical AI community](https://www.rsqrdai.org/) and helped build its brand - established presence on social media, wrote technical blog posts, and coordinated event logistics

I'm super passionate about a lot of different things - AI/ML, linguistics, design, research, product, a good flan, etc. I also have experience doing a lot of different things - marketing, project management, design work, technical writing, strategy, engineering, etc. My (incredibly) mixed background is what makes me today: someone who wants to make a difference on tomorrow's products.
